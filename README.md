# SentinelLogix
SentinelLogix is a lightweight Python-based log collection and parsing tool designed to simulate core SIEM functionalities for Windows environments. It collects predetermined Windows Event Logs, parses relevant security events, and lays the groundwork for threat detection, alerting, and future integration with other telemetry sources like network logs and running processes.

This project is intended as both a learning platform and a practical foundation for developing a custom, modular SIEM system tailored for small environments or blue team training labs.

THIS PROJECT IS ONGOING AND IT IS NOT FINISHED !!!
